# rocketseat-nlw

This is the final project built in a extremelly complete JS Fullstack Course. The **Next Level Week** is a free course made by Rocketseat team and I'm getting this opportunity to turm myself into a Fullstack dev.

In this course, we're building a complete solution using Node.js as backend REST API server, React as the frontend library and React Native with Expo for the Mobo interface.

My personal goal is to use MongoDB on the server side, for saving the data.

Please, feel free for downloading this project and see what we've done here.

Wellcome!
